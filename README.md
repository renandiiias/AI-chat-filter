# Chat Message Filter with OpenAI GPT-4

A JavaScript implementation of a chat message filter that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 API to scan and block prohibited content before messages are sent in a chat application.

## Overview

This project provides a client-side solution to ensure that any messages containing offensive language or disallowed terms are filtered out using the power of GPT-4.

## Motivation

This project is a gift to **Callum** for the insightful call we had today. Although I couldn't make the investment at this time, I took detailed notes and am already working on correcting what I was doing wrong to see what results I can achieve.

I'm also available to help implement this if needed. Applying what you taughtâ€”**provide value first**.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Detects profanity and offensive language, even if disguised using special characters, numbers, other languages, or combinations.
- **Disallowed Terms**: Blocks terms related to "scam", "do not buy", or any similar expressions.
- **Simple Integration**: Easy to integrate into existing chat applications.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
